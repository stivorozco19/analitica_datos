- [ ] Examine `No. SUSCRIPTORES ACUEDUCTO` by stratum
- [ ] Investigate temporal patterns in consumption
- [ ] Identify and investigate outliers
- [ ] Create visualizations for each analysis

### **Phase 2: Bivariate Analysis**

Explore relationships between variables:

#### **üéØ Key Relationships to Explore:**

   - Has consumption changed over the 8-year period?
   - Are there growth or decline trends by stratum?

3. **Service Coverage Analysis:**

   - Do areas with more subscribers have different consumption patterns?
   - How does coverage correlate with average consumption?

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Tasks:**
- [ ] Compare consumption across strata (boxplots/violin plots)

- [ ] Calculate correlations between key variables
- [ ] Create geographic consumption maps (if possible)
- [ ] Investigate water vs. sewerage service relationships

### **Phase 3: Multivariate Analysis**

Uncover complex patterns and interactions:

#### **üéØ Advanced Questions:**
1. **Geographic-Economic Interactions:**
   - Does the stratum-consumption relationship vary by municipality?
   - Are there municipalities where low strata consume more than expected?
   - Can we identify geographic clusters of consumption patterns?

2. **Temporal-Economic Evolution:**
   - How has the consumption gap between strata evolved over time?
   - Which strata showed the most dramatic changes during COVID-19 (2020-2021)?
   - Are there seasonal effects that vary by socioeconomic level?

3. **Service Efficiency Analysis:**
   - Do municipalities with better sewerage coverage have different water consumption?
   - Can we identify underperforming or overperforming municipalities?
   - What factors predict high consumption efficiency?

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Tasks:**
- [ ] Segment analysis by municipality + stratum combinations
- [ ] Time series analysis by stratum groups
- [ ] Correlation analysis within subgroups
- [ ] Identify Simpson's Paradox examples
- [ ] Create multidimensional visualizations

### **Phase 4: Insights & Recommendations (15 minutes)**

Generate actionable findings:

#### **üéØ Business Questions to Answer:**
1. **Policy Implications:**
   - Which strata should be targeted for water conservation programs?
   - Are subsidies properly allocated based on actual consumption patterns?
   - What municipalities need infrastructure investment?

2. **Operational Insights:**
   - Can we predict seasonal demand fluctuations?
   - Which areas show sustainable consumption growth?
   - Are there efficiency benchmarks we can establish?

3. **Social Impact:**
   - Do consumption patterns reflect expected socioeconomic differences?
   - Are there equity issues in water access or consumption?
   - How has water consumption resilience varied during the pandemic?

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Deliverables:**

print(f"Missing values per column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

## üìã Expected Data Quality Issues

Be prepared to handle:

### **Common Issues:**
- **Mixed number formats:** Some numbers use commas as thousands separators
- **Missing values:** Empty strings and NaN values
- **Inconsistent formatting:** Spanish month names, mixed data types
- **Zero consumption records:** May indicate service interruptions or data collection issues
- **Outliers:** Unusual consumption spikes or drops

### **Cleaning Suggestions:**
```python
# Convert numeric columns with commas
numeric_cols = ['A√ëO', 'No. SUSCRIPTORES ACUEDUCTO', 'CONSUMO M3 ACUEDUCTO', 
                'PROMEDIO CONSUMO ACUEDUCTO', 'No. SUSCRIPTORES ALCANTARILLADO', 
                'CONSUMO M3 ALCANTARILLADO', 'PROMEDIO CONSUMO ALCANTARILLADO']

for col in numeric_cols:
    df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col].astype(str).str.replace(',', ''), errors='coerce')

# Handle month names (Spanish to English or numeric)
month_mapping = {
    'ENERO': 1, 'FEBRERO': 2, 'MARZO': 3, 'ABRIL': 4,
    'MAYO': 5, 'JUNIO': 6, 'JULIO': 7, 'AGOSTO': 8,
    'SEPTIEMBRE': 9, 'OCTUBRE': 10, 'NOVIEMBRE': 11, 'DICIEMBRE': 12
}
df['MES_NUM'] = df['MES'].map(month_mapping)
```
